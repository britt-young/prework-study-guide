# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- Similar to having notes in a paper notebook, but I needed something that I could access anywhere (with web access) and not need my notebook at all times
- I wanted to create a consolidated location for notes that I can refer to at any time from any location and is easily shareable
- Accessibility to my notes and shareability
- Once building a strong HTML foundation, I could begin inputting my notes as soon as possible. Having an HTML template to use for all "notebook style" webpages would increase my note taking speed

## Usage

Upon navigating to the PreworkStudy Guide page and opening the DevTools console you can easily randomize your study experience. JavaScript will run and randomly choose a topic from our pre-determined list of topics, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Also, in the console tab of DevTools, we can run/ test code without altering code in VS code. In addition to randomization, there are notes included on the homepage that you can study from.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
